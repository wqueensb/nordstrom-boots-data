# nordstrom-boots-data
Obtained data from Kaggle.com on the boots sold by Nordstrom. Being a lover of fashion I decided to explore this dataset by using SQL to obtain the information I was interested in. 

[ Boots over a $100](https://github.com/wqueensb/nordstrom-boots-data/blob/main/boots_over_%24100)

Wanted to find out how many boots sold by Nordstrom are over a $100. The information I found was interesting because it affirmed Nordstrom's position in the shoe luxury space. 

[ SQL query to arrange Nordstrom boot table in descending order. ](https://github.com/wqueensb/nordstrom-boots-data/blob/b45bc5cf0760f1dfa334d6f052a883be25c1d256/descending_order_by%20retail%20price%20query)

I needed to quickly find the most expensive boot brand sold by Nordstrom so I organized the table in descending order. Also, I wanted my integers converted to a currency format.  

[ Doc Martens ](https://github.com/wqueensb/nordstrom-boots-data/blob/main/dr_martens_styles)

One of my favorite styles is the iconic Dr. Martens created in 1947. So I decided to create a query that would let me know the different Dr. Marten styles sold by Nordstrom.
