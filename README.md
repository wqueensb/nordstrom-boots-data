# nordstrom-boots-data
Obtained data from Kaggle.com on the boots sold by Nordstrom. Being a lover of fashion I decided to explore this dataset by using SQL to obtain the information I was interested in. 

[ Boots over a $100](https://github.com/wqueensb/nordstrom-boots-data/blob/main/boots_over_%24100)

Wanted to find out how many boots sold by Nordstrom are over a $100. The information I found was interesting because it affirmed Nordstrom's position in the shoe luxury space. 

[ SQL query to arrange Nordstrom boot table in descending order. ](

I needed to quickly find the most expensive boot brand sold by Nordstrom so I organized the table in descending order. Also, I wanted my integers converted to a currency format.
